Each principal signs up and enters school, the number of teams, and provides a school list of students first name, last initial and email. The principal adds teacher accounts by inputting teacher emails.
For students/teachers to sign up they receive email with a link to set up their password, their username will be their first name, last initial for students, and for teachersâ€™ last name.
House teams will be assigned once the principal provides the list of students.
Teachers can award points in the app by searching for a student and giving them points along with short description.
Students will be able to see their recent points with descriptions.
Leaderboard should show student high scores, and team scores.

We will need to send an email to a principal to sign up for their school. This will bring them to the school sign up page, this page must include a way to enter number of teams, student list, and enter teacher email addresses. 
From there we need to make students sign up page where the student sets their password, their username will automatically be their name or email.
The teacher sign up page will have them set their password. Teachers automatically have their last name as their username but are allowed to change it, unlike the students.
We will need to program the app so that it randomly assigns a house to each student but evenly distributed.
We will need to program the teacher account so that it can add or remove points from students with descriptions. Teachers can view the leaderboards.
Student accounts can view leaderboards and their recent points with descriptions.
